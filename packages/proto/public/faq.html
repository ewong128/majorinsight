        <ul>
            <li>Do you have to create an account to make a post?</li>
            Yes, you must make an account to post, as it is a security and verification process.
            <li>Do you have to log in to see reviews?</li>
            No, it is public, so you don't need to make an account or log in.
            <li>What does the rating mean?</li>
            The rating is an average of all the ratings for that specific major.
            <li>What does it mean by program in the post page?</li>
            In the case of the post page, the program mean whether you are in the undergraduate(1-4 year), Master(after
            undergrad at somewhere else), and Blended (5-6 year at Cal Poly).
            <li>How can I believe the reviews?</li>
            For the most part, most reviewers will be verified Cal Poly Students before making a post, but there are
            loop holes, hence there may be occassional cases of falsify reviews, but will try to mitigate such issues.
            <li>How does verification work?</li>
            The user will be asked for a calpoly email and will be sent an email that they physically need to agree to.
            <li>What is a review?</li>
            It is a summary and opinionated response to your Cal Poly specific major.
            <li>Should I believe the review?</li>
            Every review should be taken with a grain of salt such as it could be true, but can also be untrue, not
            necessarily false, as the reviews are based upon opinions.
            <li>Can posts be removed?</li>
            At the current stage, posts will not be remove, so please make sure if you are a reviewer and making a post,
            make sure you oblige by the rules.
