        <h4>Anomyous - Undergrad (Class of 2004)</h4>
        <p>
            Going to Poly for Computer Science was a great move. Not only did it prepare me for the professional world
            (Big Blue), but I feel like I had a step up on other new hires due to my education. As noted by others,
            there is not much diversity in the student population and the housing situation is pretty bad. Though, not
            any worse than any other university.

            Well, I mainly just hate the location. It's HOURS from sane civilization. The school teaches you well. The
            faculty is absolutely horrible, and you are definitely treated like Student #403228-102 instead of (insert
            your name here) I really feel like I'm saving lives by people who are reading this and considering this
            school. It definitely has an edge over other universities, but this is not a university that is for
            everyone. The education quality is overall great, but once you move here, you realize that the quality of
            education is not all that matters. You MUST LOVE to live in small, secluded areas because that is exactly
            what San Luis Obispo is. If you prefer the excitement of a city, you are choosing the wrong place. If you
            think you are one of those people who can leave the excitement behind and just worry about college stuff, I
            encourage you to try visiting and definitely consider your options before going here. I personally could not
            stand the atmosphere, and that seems to have caused me a lot of grief in my schoolwork because I had no
            social life whatsoever without either going to Los Angeles or San Francisco. I think I would have committed
            suicide if I hadn't had a car. I'm not saying that you shouldn't consider this school, but there's no way I
            could ever recommend it just because of my personality type. I need big cities, excitement, and an abundance
            of different cultures and ideas. The small town, conservative thing just didn't work out for me. I just
            consider you to visit and make the right choice for you. There are plenty of great schools, you just have to
            find the one that's best for you. If you decide later that it's not the school for you, think of how much
            you have wasted being miserable.

            Another thing to mention isâ€”for first time freshman, make sure you know exactly what field you want to go
            into before applying. Don't just put down anything on the application thinking you can change later. IT IS
            EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO CHANGE MAJORS AT THIS SCHOOL. It's much easier to change within your college (ie.
            Computer Science to Computer Engineering), but to change to a major outside of your college (ie. Computer
            Science to Graphic Communications) would cost you at least $4,400 (two quarters) of tuition trying to do so
            because you are required to simultaneously take current major and support classes along with major classes
            in your requested major. If you cannot complete these successfully (along with a lot of paperwork and
            advisor chats), you won't be allowed into the new college, and you'll have wasted your time, sweat, and
            tears. BE CAREFUL. MAKE A DECISION YOU WON'T REGRET.
